    We have tapped LPC bus in a BitLocker-protected laptop and captured the commucation between CPU and TPM.
    Could you recover Volume Master Key from the capture?

    Each capture contains wrong data at random positions due to the technical limitation of sampling rate.
    We've captured the communication 5 times separately for correcting the glitches.

    Notes:
    * Each line in a csv file represents captured signal lines and decoded LPC bus data from the signal lines.
    * Some bytes transmitted over LPC bus are decoded wrongfully and some other bytes are dropped.
    * LPC bus specification: https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/program/design/us/en/documents/low-pin-count-interface-specification.pdf
    * Signals should be sampled on the rising edge of LCLK.
    * You can import csv file into PulseView with column formats `t,-,*b`.
        *  LPC decoder in sigrok-cli/PulseView doesn't work correctly for these capture.
    * The target device is TPM 1.2.
